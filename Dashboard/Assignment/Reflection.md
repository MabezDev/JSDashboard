# Reflection
Overall I am happy with my dashboard but there are few limitations I couldnt overcome due to some of the design choices I made early on. I chose to create all items/widgets using html elements, although this simplified the creation of widgets and items initially later on I lacked absolute control over positionioning, something I would have had if I choose the canvas route.

## What I think went well
The way Objects are stored and the Object structure is fully self contained, thus when It came to save an entire widget I could just call toJSON() on every child object of the widget. Initially I had the user saving widgets and layouts filenames, but quickly realized it would be a pain to validate there filenames and check that it exits etc, instead I added some meta fields to the saved widget/layout to include tags and a description withing the file itself, thus I could just hand it to the server and let it choose a random random filename. The random file name ended up being a great idea as in the widget manager if you inspect them there id's are actaully there filenames, this will always work as they are always unique. 

## What could I change to make it better
Although I used some features of ES6 (fat arrow notation <3) Using ES6 Classes would have Shrunk my factory.js file alot by having base classes for items and widgets. Given time (my fault completely) I would have liked to completely remove all tradition xhrs and replace them with fetch on the client and pure promises on the server, I used some promises on the server but cutting out effectivley duplicate code from xhr requests on the client would save so much space and time wasted searching for functions.
